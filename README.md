# Urban-Growth-Seattle
This project analyzes whether development activity and pricing respond with a lag to public infrastructure improvements in Seattle â€” and whether this reveals overlooked growth opportunities. Using open data on permits, infrastructure, and housing prices, we explore spatial and temporal patterns of urban change.

## Goals
- Analyze trends in building permits near infrastructure projects
- Identify time lags or gaps in response
- Visualize potential arbitrage zones in development timing

## Data Sources
See `data/sources.md` for links and licensing.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, geopandas)
- Tableau / Power BI
- QGIS (optional for mapping)
- GitHub for collaboration
